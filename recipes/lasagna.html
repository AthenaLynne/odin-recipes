<h2>Description</h2>
<p1>The worlds best lasagna is a labor of love. She consists of 14 hours of work, talent and lots of patience. The recipe uses simple ingredents, but utilizes the best version of those we could source. We didn't use just any ricotta. We bought fresh cream from a farm, milked this morning, and make our own riccota. We think you should too!
